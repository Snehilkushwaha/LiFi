tramsmission image processing

take a image
break it into 3 rgb matrix 
convert each matrix into binary format
now turbo encode each r g b binary sequence

transmission part

one light on will mark the begining of data transmission both lights off will mark the end of data transmission.
firtsly record the intensity of all the 3 stages.
one led on
both led on
both led off

then setup the limits so that the binary sequence can be constructed.




receiver part

receive the turbo encoded code 
then turbo decode it to get back the binary sequence 
then reshape the binary sequence to get the rgb matrix 
then concatenate them to reconstruct the image back.
